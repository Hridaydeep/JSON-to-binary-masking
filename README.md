# JSON-to-binary-masking
It is a Python code where it reads a JSON file, which contains an annotation of the image that is done using VGG Image Annotation. And it converts the annotations into Binary masking. It works fine for multiple annotations and for each annotation it delivers a  individual Binary mask in a png format.
